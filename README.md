# Habit-Tracker
The concept of a habit tracker is described as a visual tool to help maintain consistency and build better habits. 
This visual representation of your progress helps to reinforce the habit by creating a chain of successes, making it more rewarding to continue. 
The tracker serves as a powerful reminder of your commitment and offers a tangible way to monitor and celebrate your progress.
I have used HTML , CSS and Javascript to creating a calender and helps me track my habit one at a time.
